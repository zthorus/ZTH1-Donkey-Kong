# ZTH1-Donkey-Kong
Donkey-Kong game for the ZTH1 RISC micro-computer 

This is a simple Donkey-Kong game written in Forth for the ZTH1 RISC micro-computer. It was intended as a test of the ZTH1 Forth cross-compiler. Along with the source code, the mif files (object code) is provided.

This game has only one level (the classic first level) and requires a joystick (plugged on the Arduino port of the Maximator FPGA board on which the ZTH1 computer has to be synthesized). Since the fire button cannot be used, push the joystick up to jump (to dodge the barrels) and to climb a ladder (if Mario is at the bottom of a ladder).
